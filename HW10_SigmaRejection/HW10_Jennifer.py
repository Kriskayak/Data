This is because the median and MAD of the full distribution don't take in account the ouliers that can be rejected with a 95% confidence. The median and MAD of the sigma-rejected distribution better capture the overall trend of the data. ''''''js comments----------- - You are not understanding what the error function is and how it is used. It   returns a probability. The inverse error function is needed.  - There are sigma clip algorithms already written, your task was to understand   how it works by writing your own.  - The sigmaclip parameters were way too stringent, and did not conform to the    directions - The sigma-rejected array is not valid5/20'''
